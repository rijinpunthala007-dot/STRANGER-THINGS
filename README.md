# Stranger Things - The Interactive Chronicle

A cinematic, interactive web experience inspired by the hit series "Stranger Things". This project features immersive background animations, a retro 80s aesthetic, and a "scrollytelling" interface that reveals the story of Hawkins, season by season.

## Features

*   **Cinematic Welcome Screen:** A high-end intro with neon flickering text and a heartbeat vignette.
*   **Interactive Backgrounds:** Canvas-based animations for each season (The Upside Down, Mind Flayer particles, Starcourt Mall neon, Vecna's clock chimes).
*   **Scrollytelling Text Reveal:** A "Decoder Effect" that scrambles and reveals text as you scroll.
*   **Dynamic Soundscapes:** (Planned) Audio interactions to enhance the immersion.
*   **Custom Cursor:** A dynamic cursor that changes based on the current season/theme.

## Technologies

*   HTML5 Canvas
*   Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
